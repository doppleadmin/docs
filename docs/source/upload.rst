Upload  
=====

Choose the upload option if you have some data and want to generate synthetic data in the same format, and maintaining the same relationships between variables.

Currently, Doppledata supports only CSV input. 

1. So if you have the source data available as a CSV, then just click on upload to upload it. 

The uploaded data is shown in a tabular format for you to verify that the right file has been uploaded. 

2. Choose how many rows of synthetic data to generate (Keep an eye on your daily quota in the bottom right of the screen, the quota resets at 00:00 UTC)

3. Click on **SYNTHESIZE**

4. In a few seconds, the table will update to show the generated synthetic data and you will see a **DOWNLOAD** button that allows you to download the generated file as a CSV

5. If you would like to try again with another file, click on **BACK**
