Create
=====

Choose the create option if you do not have any source data but have some idea in mind on what to generate.

1. Click on **CREATE TABLE**. 

You will see an empty table that you need to fill up. 

At the least you need to fill up the header row with the column names of the data you want to generate. This is the minimum requirement for zero shot synthesis to work.

If you enter one or more rows of example data as well, this will ensure the data fits closer to the examples you have defined. But this is not mandatory.

2. Choose how many rows of synthetic data to generate (Keep an eye on your daily quota in the bottom right of the screen, the quota resets at 00:00 UTC)

3. Click on **SYNTHESIZE**

4. In a few seconds, the table will update to show the generated synthetic data and you will see a **DOWNLOAD** button that allows you to download the generated file as a CSV

5. If you would like to try again, click on **BACK**
